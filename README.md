# Air-Quality-Dataset

About Dataset
This dataset contains daily records of air pollutant concentrations collected over time, including PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and Ozone. It also logs the Air Quality Index (AQI), along with date (day, month, year) also includes number of holidays and weekday representation. It is ideal for developing models to predict AQI, study pollution patterns, and analyze the effects of temporal or holiday factors on air quality.
